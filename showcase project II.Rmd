# Share of Renewable Energy Production in the world

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting
dataset on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150
countries since 1800. This is the[Cross-country Historical Adoption of
Technology (CHAT)
dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/cross-country-historical-adoption-technology).

The following is a description of the variables

| **variable** | **class** | **description**                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| variable     | character | Variable name                  |
| label        | character | Label for variable             |
| iso3c        | character | Country code                   |
| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

```{r,load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies

  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))

#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")

# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)

```

This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for
many other technologies. In our case, we just need to produce a couple
of graphs-- at this stage, the emphasis is on data manipulation.

First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest %
contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of
`elec_hydro`, `elec_solar`, `elec_wind`, and `elec_renew_other`. You may
want to use the *patchwork* package to assemble the two charts next to
each other.

```{r min-max_renewables, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(p)
```

Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between
CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of
energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem
to go down?

```{r animation, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "animation.gif"), error = FALSE)
```

To create this animation is actually straight-forward. You manipulate
your date, and the create the graph in the normal ggplot way. the only
`gganimate` layers you need to add to your graphs are

      labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
           x = '% renewables', 
           y = 'CO2 per cap') +
      transition_time(year) +
      ease_aes('linear')
